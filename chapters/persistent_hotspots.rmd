## Implications
Persistent hotpots through time identify places where seabirds, marine mammals and sea turtles frequently aggregate to feed, and may indicate locations of seasonal and annual resilience. Individual hotspot richness maps represent annual persistent hotspots of 71 species and also common taxa challenging to identify to the species level on at-sea surveys but whose abundance and spatial patterns significantly contribute to richness and diversity on the Atlantic EEZ. The integrated maps represent very high densities and very high persistence; however, one or both parameters can be adjusted to identify other important locations, for example, to reveal areas of high density and moderate persistence.
