## Introduction to Indicator
The amount of forage fish available in the ecosystem combined with the energy content of the forage species determines the amount of energy potentially available to predators in the ecosystem. Changes in the forage base could pose a risk to managed and protected species production. This spatially-explicit forage index estimated the combined biomass of 21 forage species using stomach contents information from 22 predatory fish species collected on bottom trawl surveys. 

In addition to an index of forage abundance in each EPU, the coastwide center of gravity for the combined forage biomass was estimated. Consistent movement of the center of gravity towards the north or east indicates a distribution shift for combined forage fish.

## Key Results and Visualizations
Variables plotted are Fall Forage Fish Biomass Estimate and Spring Forage Fish Biomass Estimate with error bands from Fall Forage Fish Biomass Estimate SE and Spring Forage Fish Biomass Estimate SE, respectively. Time series were extended back to 1982 and forward to 2023 in this update, but this did not change the trends reported previously for 1982-2022.

### MidAtlantic

```{r plot_forage_indexMidAtlanticindex}
# Plot indicator
ggplotObject <- ecodata::plot_forage_index(report= 'MidAtlantic', varName= 'index',n=10)
ggplotObject
```

```{r plot_forage_indexMidAtlanticcog}
# Plot indicator
ggplotObject <- ecodata::plot_forage_index(report= 'MidAtlantic', varName= 'cog',n=10)
ggplotObject
```

### NewEngland

# Plot indicator
ggplotObject <- ecodata::plot_forage_index(report= 'NewEngland', varName= 'index',n=10)
ggplotObject
```

```{r plot_forage_indexNewEnglandcog}

## Implications
The resulting indices for the Mid-Atlantic show a long term decrease in fall and overall higher forage fish in fall relative to spring (Fig. \@ref(fig:MAforagebio)), with highest forage biomass during fall in the early-1980s. 

In New England, the forage index shows an overall higher forage fish biomass in fall relative to spring (Fig. \@ref(fig:NEforagebio)). There is a long-term increasing trend in the spring in GOM.  

Changes in the distribution of forage biomass also affects predator distribution. Since 1982, the fall center of gravity of forage fish has moved to the north and east. The spring forage center of gravity shows higher variability than fall, and a significant trend to the north.
