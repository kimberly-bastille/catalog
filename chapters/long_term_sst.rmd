## Introduction to Indicator
The data presented here are average annual sea-surface temperatures from the NOAA extended reconstructed sea surface temperature data set (ERSST V5) on the Northeast Continental Shelf.

## Key Results and Visualizations
Since the 1860â€™s, the Northeast US shelf sea surface temperature (SST) has exhibited an overall warming trend, with the past decade measuring well above the long term average.


## Indicator statistics 
Spatial scale: Full shelf

Temporal scale: Annual

**Synthesis Theme**:

- [X] Multiple System Drivers


```{r autostats_long_term_sst}
# Either from Contributor or ecodata
```

## Implications
Long term SST demonstrates that the annual average sea surface temperatures observed during the most recent ten years are well above the historical average dating back to the 1860s.
