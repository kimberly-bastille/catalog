## Introduction to Indicator
Many deep water benthic and demersal exhibit thermal preferences for metabolic, reproductive, and growth processes. Temperatures above these thermal presences may impair these processes. Data originate from GLORYS12V1 global reanalysis for 1993-01-01 to 2023-08-29, and from PSY forecasts from 2021-01-01 to 2023-12-31. Cells are mapped to 3 depth bins: 0-25m, 25-100m, and >100m. Two temperature thresholds are used representing a temperature where moderate (15C) and extreme (24C) thermal stresses are likely to occur across several species. GLORYS and PSY 1/12 degree grid is mapped to EPU_NOESTUARIES shape files by the center point of each grid cell.

## Key Results and Visualizations
Maps of full NE shelf with cells shading gradient showing number of days exceeding temperature thresholds. For 15C threshold, much of the southern MAB experienced >100 days, as well as along the shelf break and around Nantucket Shoals. In 2023, only the southern and/or shallow portion of the MAB exceeded the 24C threshold.

## Implications
Using a high resolution bottom temperature product allows for localized heat stress within EPUs that may be masked when looking at mean EPU bottom temperature. This can be important to sessile species who aren't able to move out of warm water conditions.
